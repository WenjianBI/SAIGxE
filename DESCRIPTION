Description: A scalable and accurate method, SPAGE (SaddlePoint Approximation implementation of GxE analysis), that is applicable for genome-wide scale phenome-wide GxE studies (PheWIS). SPAGE fits a genotype-independent logistic model only once across the whole-genome analysis to reduce computation cost and uses a saddlepoint approximation (SPA) to calibrate the test statistics for analysis of phenotypes with unbalanced case-control ratios.
